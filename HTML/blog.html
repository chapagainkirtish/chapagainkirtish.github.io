                    <p>As people are transcending to the better variables, development is of course the fruition of it.
                        Development of technology is inevitable and it unenviably applies to botany field as well. Mass
                        opting for easy options, mass media fueling it and ascending features of technology integrates.
                        Nonetheless business either benefit or tumble down from the development of technology that has
                        affected our daily life, with often noxious consequences. </p>
                    <p>Bonsai, the major fundamental of our economy ,according to google is the art of
                        growing ornamental, artificially dwarfed varieties of trees and shrubs in pots. For us bonsai
                        more
                        than a plant, is a memory imprint that signifies the dignity imprinted since generations. And as
                        art
                        to the artist, memories to the dwellers and care to the cravers, Boonsai has aspired to be the
                        inspiration of all these three for the aspirants. </p>
                    <p>Technology directly affiliated with the business and the economy inflation and deflation
                        likewise,
                        it's no surprise that technology business has grasped the local and global population, albeit
                        the
                        exploitation of it has many tradition based business on disarray. The demand that bonsai asks,
                        the
                        meticulous care it requires and the way technology more than improve, deceases the condition of
                        flourishing bonsai, fall of bonsai business without sugar coating is inevitable, pre-destined
                        even.

                    </p>
                    <p>Over the decades, people flourishing with flourishing technology have had a major fundamental
                        shift
                        in the way bonsai were viewed by the majority. Before it was alike a jade to the Chinese
                        honourable,
                        harmony or significance of relations to be precise. Later the meticulous attention a bonsai
                        required
                        which was its pride had it clutching to its very own downfall. Technology that had people
                        grappling
                        on undemanding, unchallenging, tranquil, effortless, facile and simple lifestyle, couldn’t
                        cherish
                        the prestige of bonsai that was once the stature of superiority. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="actual-blog-text2">
                    <p>Despite that, the technology did invite a major audience from the west and even the parts of the
                        world that were unaware of the eminence of bonsai. Bonsai strived and we did scramble the
                        admirers
                        of bonsai together. The arrival of internet and the availability of its facilities had the
                        aspirants
                        learn and love bonsai even without having a physical vision of it. Technology without a doubt
                        carved
                        an impression among the people, prominence of bonsai blooming again. </p>
                    <p>Internet had the population not only reminisce the notability of bonsai but even made it possible
                        to
                        own one. The support nurtures received made it available for the supporters to nurture their own
                        bonsai, bonding the boon passed from the generations that they were to the generations we are
                        today.
                        Appreciation of the art, patience, care, memories and admiration bonsai offers, bonsai had made
                        an
                        unquenchable thirst to the aficionados. Call them fanatics, addicts or zealots but the
                        prevailing
                        love for bonsai even today has never not ceased to exist. </p>
                    <p>Arguably the vision led by technology is to be noted for sure. Technology arguably both boon and
                        curse for the bonsai, led, is leading and will be leading the trends of the bonsai business. the
                        fall and rise of bonsai has been in the clutches of trend of the technology like a puppet is to
                        a
                        puppeteer. Bonsai, as a vision of the past, concluded as the 7th sense even, depends upon the
                        exposure by the tech without a doubt. Bonsai is more than mere genetic modification, it’s a
                        botanical treasure, a hierophant of superiority, the poured hard work for bountiful elegance,
                        representation of mediation and even contemplation. </p>

                    <p>Bonsai, not being an inherent of technology has a fair par corners and stubbles of advantages and
                        disadvantages . On the bright side,
                        technology can help in automating and streamlining bonsai tree maintenance. Watering systems,
                        for
                        instance, can assist in ensuring that the flora are receiving the appropriate amount of water at
                        the
                        appropriate time. In order to enhance growth and health, technology may also be used to monitor
                        and
                        adjust the daylight and temperature conditions in a bonsai growing environment.</p>
                    <p>Process automation such as watering, fertilizing, and trimming with technology can help to
                        guarantee
                        that bonsai plants can get proper care and attention they need. It has allowed bonsai farmers
                        and
                        retailers to promote and sell their plants online, which can reach a wider audience and increase
                        revenues.</p>
                    <p>Technology can also result in an over-reliance on artificial methods of preservation and care,
                        which
                        is a disadvantage. For example, if a bonsai tree is being grown inside a controlled environment
                        using artificial lighting, it might not gain the same durability and strength as a tree grown in
                        the
                        nature. The over-pruning and over-styling of bonsai trees that can result from technology can
                        also
                        decrease their natural beauty and aesthetic appeal.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="actual-blog-text2">
                    <p>Growers who rely too heavily on technology can find it challenging to react to unexpected
                        problems or
                        changes in the environment. Small-scale growers might not be able to afford the high cost of
                        technology and machinery. Cybersecurity threats including hacking, data breaches, and fraud may
                        be
                        present for bonsai producers and dealers as a result of online sales and marketing.</p>
                    <p>

                        In conclusion, technology can have a positive or negative impact on bonsai plants' quality of
                        life
                        and ability to flourish. On the one hand, technology can be utilized to monitor and alter the
                        growing environment to maximize growth and health as well as automate and simplify the care and
                        maintenance of bonsai trees. Technology can also be utilized to enhance production, and internet
                        marketing and sales can increase profitability. Nevertheless, technology can also result in an
                        over-reliance on artificial maintenance and care methods, excess trimming and styling, high
                        expenses, and cybersecurity issues. In order to maintain bonsai plants' natural beauty and
                        aesthetic
                        appeal while ensuring their health and vitality, it is crucial to use technology properly and in
                        proportion. </p>

                    <p>Bonsai is the living craftmanship from human beings to nature. There's nothing more intriguing
                        than a
                        miniature of your favorite tree in your favorite spot. It's an indulgent that we believe
                        everyone
                        deserves, sappy as it gets yet nothing better than it. (gardenerspath.com) </p>
                    <p>Because bonsai rather seems to be an eastern thing, newbies often get themselves pondering about
                        the
                        bonsai they should purchase. And sometimes taking risk is just not worth it. </p>
                    <p>Bonsai is more than a decorative miniature tree and it requires more than just watering and
                        sunshine
                        than your usual plants. Every aspect should be carefully considered, even decorations fearing
                        few
                        decorative could have properties against bonsai's needs. </p>
                    <p>Ficus Bonsai is undeniably the easiest among all to care for. Ficus is unbothered of low humidity
                        and
                        is very resilient, making the best for the beginners. Plus it survives equally well indoors.

                    <p>Juniper even better, is an evergreen specie, a bonsai classic. This outdoor bonsai doesn't have a

                        days.
                        Thus, the aesthetic remains unaffected without looking barbaric. (allthingsbonsai.co.uk) </p>
