                    1. What is a bonsai plant?

                <div class="inner-need-help-text">
                    A miniature tree that has been grown and trained in a small pot is called a bonsai plant. The goal
                    of bonsai is to methodically shape, wire, and prune the branches, leaves, and trunk to create a
                    miniature, lifelike replica of an adult tree. There are many different types of bonsai plants,
                    including juniper, pine, azalea, and ficus. Each species has its own unique characteristics and
                    requirements for care.

                <!-- answers for FAQs -->
                <div class="inner-need-help-text">
                    A bonsai plant needs regular watering, feeding, pruning, and repotting in order to be taken care of.
                    Additionally, certain daylight and temperature requirements apply to bonsai plants. Studying the
                    particular requirements of your chosen bonsai plant species is essential. Every one in three years,
                    bonsai plants should normally be repotted. The size of the root system and the species can, however,
                    affect how frequently plants need to be replanted.

                    A bonsai plant is shaped by wiring and pruning the branches to get the desired shape. When sculpting
                    a bonsai plant, it's important to be careful and patient. Overpruning or incorrect wiring may result
                    in tree damage.

                <div class="inner-need-help-text">
                    Although bonsai trees need routine maintenance, with the right information and care, they can be rather simple to take care of. To make sure that you are giving the proper care and conditions, it is crucial to conduct research on the specific requirements of your bonsai plant species.
